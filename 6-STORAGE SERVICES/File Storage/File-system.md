# What is a File System?
- In a computer, a file system -- sometimes written filesystem -- is the way in which files are named and where they are 
  placed logically for storage and retrieval
- Without a file system, stored information wouldn't be isolated into individual files and would be difficult to identify 
  and retrieve
