# When to use SSD vs. HDD
# SSD
- You should use a solid state drive (SSD) when you need high speeds or deal with frequent read/writes on large data 
  volume
- SSDs are a better choice for data analytics or gaming workloads
- Performance latency
- SSDs are more cost-effective for storing high-volume data with infrequent access
# HDD
- On the other hand, a hard disk drive (HDD) is a better choice if you are dealing with data backups, data archives, or 
  throughput-intensive workloads
