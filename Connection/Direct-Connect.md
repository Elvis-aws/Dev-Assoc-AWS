# AWS Direct Connect
- Establishes a private network between AWS and on-premise Data Centre
- It can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network 
  experience than internet-based connections
- Ensure smooth and reliable data transfers at massive scale for real-time analysis, rapid data backup, or broadcast 
  media processing
- Link your AWS and on-premises networks to build applications that span environments without compromising performance
- Once you link your network to AWS Direct Connect, you can use SiteLink to send data between your locations. 
  When using SiteLink, data travels over the shortest path between locations
