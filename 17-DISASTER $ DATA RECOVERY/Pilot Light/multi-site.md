# Multi-Site
- A multi-site solution runs on AWS as well as on your existing on-site infrastructure in an active-active configuration
- The data replication method that you employ will be determined by the recovery point that you choose, either Recovery 
  Time Objective (the maximum allowable downtime before degraded operations are restored) or Recovery Point Objective 
  (the maximum allowable time window whereby you will accept the loss of transactions during the DR process)
