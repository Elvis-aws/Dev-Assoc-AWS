# Warm Standby
- The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment 
  is always running in the cloud
- A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation
- It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running
- By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on
- This is more costly compared to Pilot Light
