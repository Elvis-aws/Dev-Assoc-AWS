# Access Control List
- Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another account can 
  access a resource
- ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account
- Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs
