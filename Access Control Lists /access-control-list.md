# Access Control List
- Organizations can use access control lists (ACL) to secure data
- One of the major reasons to use access control lists is to restrict unauthorized users from accessing business-sensitive 
  information
- It can also be used to control network traffic by limiting the number of users accessing files, systems, and information
- Within Amazon S3, you can use ACLs to give read or write access on buckets or objects to groups of users
- With ACLs, you can only grant other AWS accounts (not specific users) access to your Amazon S3 resources
