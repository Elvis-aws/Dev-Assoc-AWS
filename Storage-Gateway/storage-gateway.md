# Storage Gateway / Volume Gateway
- AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud 
  storage
- The service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that 
  seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access
- With cached volumes, the AWS Volume Gateway stores the full volume in its Amazon S3 service bucket, and just the 
  recently accessed data is retained in the gateway’s local cache for low-latency access
