# A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows 
# into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. 
# Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) 
# tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.
