# Spot
- Quote the maximum price
- Cheapest (upto 90% off) BUT NO Guarantees
# Pricing
- In the older Spot instance model, you bid for spot instances and the highest bidder wins
- In the new Spot instance model, you quote your maximum price. Prices are decided by long term trends
# Important things to note about Spot instances:
- Up to 90% off (compared to On-Demand)
- Can be terminated with a 2 minute notice
- Ideal for Non time-critical workloads that can tolerate interruptions (fault-tolerant)
- (Best Practice) Stop or Hibernate EC2 instance on receiving interruption notice
