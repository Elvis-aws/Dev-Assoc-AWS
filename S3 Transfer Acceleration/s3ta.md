# Transfer Acceleration
- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance 
  transfer of larger objects
- Customers who have either web or mobile applications with widespread users or applications hosted far away from their S3 
  bucket can experience long and variable upload and download speeds over the Internet
- S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) reduces the variability in Internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, 
  and logically shortens the distance to S3 for remote applications
- S3TA improves transfer performance by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed Edge Locations and 
  over AWS backbone networks, and by using network protocol optimizations
- You can turn on S3TA with a few clicks in the S3 console, and test its benefits from your location with a speed comparison tool
- With S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated
