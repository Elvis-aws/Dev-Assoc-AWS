# S3 Cloudfront
- As S3 is a serverless service, you don’t need to manage or patch servers that store files yourself; you just put and 
  get your content 
- CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, 
  and APIs around the world, securely and at scale
- By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users
- CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations
- Using edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers are 
  located 
- When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location
- If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast (low-latency) 
  response
- If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin 
- By caching your content in Edge Locations, CloudFront reduces the load on your S3 bucket and helps ensure a faster 
  response for your users when they request content
- Also, data transfer out for content by using CloudFront is often more cost-effective than serving files directly from 
  S3, and there is no data transfer fee from S3 to CloudFront
- You only pay for what is delivered to the internet from CloudFront, plus request fees
