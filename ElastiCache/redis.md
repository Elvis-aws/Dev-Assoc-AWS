# Redis
- Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a 
  database, cache, message broker, and queue
- Redis now delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for real-time applications 
  in Gaming, Ad-Tech, Financial Services, Healthcare, and IoT
- Redis is a popular choice for caching, session management, gaming, leaderboards, real-time analytics, geospatial, 
  ride-hailing, chat/messaging, media streaming, and pub/sub apps
- All Redis data resides in the server’s main memory, in contrast to databases such as PostgreSQL, Cassandra, MongoDB and 
  others that store most data on disk or on SSDs
- In comparison to traditional disk based databases where most operations require a roundtrip to disk, in-memory data 
  stores such as Redis don’t suffer the same penalty
- They can therefore support an order of magnitude more operations and faster response times
- The result is – blazing fast performance with average read or write operations taking less than a millisecond and 
  support for millions of operations per second
