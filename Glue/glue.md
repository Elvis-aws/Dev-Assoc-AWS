- AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and 
  load their data for analytics
- ETL is a data pipeline that involves a three-step process: extract, transform, and load
- First, extract the data from various sources. Then, transform the data by cleaning, filtering, summarizing, and more. 
  Finally, load. So, this type of data processing has reached maturity. And itâ€™s typical to use ETL batch processing in 
  the earlier days. 
- Here are some specific examples of ETL batch processes today
1. Processing of monthly sales data into a data warehouse.
2. Gathering daily fingerprint scans with date and time from a biometrics machine. This is useful for employee time and 
   attendance.
3. Combining client profiles for two merging companies.
