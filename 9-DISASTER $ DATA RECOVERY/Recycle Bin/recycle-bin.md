# Recycle Bin 
- A data recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs
- When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you 
  specify before being permanently deleted
- After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource is removed from the Recycle Bin and you can use it in 
  the same way that you use any other resource of that type in your account
- Using Recycle Bin helps to ensure business continuity by protecting your business-critical data against accidental 
  deletion
