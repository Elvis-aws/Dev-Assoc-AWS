# AWS Data Pipeline
- For real time transfer and data processing
- For batch transfer and data processing (ETL)
- Process and moves data between S3, RDS, DynamoDB, EMR, On-premise data sources in an automated manner
# Here are few important things to remember:
- Creates complex data processing workloads that are fault-tolerant, repeatable, and highly available
- AWS Data Pipeline launches required resources and tear them down after execution
- AWS Data Pipeline is NOT for streaming data!
