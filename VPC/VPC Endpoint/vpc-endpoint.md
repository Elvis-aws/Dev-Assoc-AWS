# VPC Endpoint 
- A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered 
  by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection
- Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service
- AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of 
  data to the public Internet
- When you use VPC endpoint, the traffic between your VPC and the other AWS service does not leave the Amazon network
