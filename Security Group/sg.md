# Security Groups are stateful
- I went to a movie with my son. During the film, he needed to go to the restroom
- The staff member at the door let him leave the theater and allowed him to re-enter afterwards
- This is an example of a stateful request -- he went out and was allowed back in. However, somebody who simply tried 
  to get into the theater would be rejected
- Similarly, your computer at home is connected to a router
- The router protects it from the evils of the Internet
- Traffic can't come through your router to your computer
- However, if you make a request to go to a website, that request goes out of your router and the response is allowed 
  back in because it is stateful
- That is, the router remembers that you made the request to that website and it permits the response to come back to 
  your computer
