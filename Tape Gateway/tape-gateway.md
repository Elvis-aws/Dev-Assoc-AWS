  existing backup workflows
- Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on-premises for low-latency data access
- Tape Gateway encrypts data between the gateway and AWS for secure data transfer and compresses data while transitioning 
  virtual tapes between Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier, or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, to minimize storage costs
- Tape Gateway compresses and stores archived virtual tapes in the lowest-cost Amazon S3 storage classes, Amazon S3 Glacier 
  and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
