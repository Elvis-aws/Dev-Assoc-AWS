# Amazon Kinesis 
- This is an Amazon Web Service designed to process large-scale data streams from a multitude of services in real-time. 
- It can be considered, like Apache Kafka, as a kind of message broker
- This means that it operates as a middleman between various data generating sources, to allow other applications or 
  services to work with the source data
- One of the key benefits of Kinesis (and Kafka) is that it allows you to process and analyze data nearly immediately, 
  rather than waiting for a complete dataset to arrive, then processing it, then delivering it for analysis
- Insights can be derived in minutes, rather than hours, days or weeks
- Kinesis makes this possible without weeks of complicated setup, as it is delivered as a managed platform, meaning you 
  do not have to manage any infrastructure
- It can scale with very low latency
# Streaming data
- Data that is generated continuously by thousands of data sources, which typically send in the data records simultaneously, 
  and in small sizes (order of Kilobytes)
- Streaming data includes a wide variety of data such as log files generated by customers using your mobile or web applications, 
  ecommerce purchases, in-game player activity, information from social networks, financial trading floors, or geospatial services, 
  and telemetry from connected devices or instrumentation in data centers
# Streaming data processing 
- This requires two layers: a storage layer and a processing layer
- The storage layer needs to support record ordering and strong consistency to enable fast, inexpensive, and re-playable 
  reads and writes of large streams of data
- The processing layer is responsible for consuming data from the storage layer, running computations on that data, and 
- then notifying the storage layer to delete data that is no longer needed
- You also have to plan for scalability, data durability, and fault tolerance in both the storage and processing layers
- As a result, many platforms have emerged that provide the infrastructure needed to build streaming data applications 
  including Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), 
  Apache Flume, Apache Spark Streaming, and Apache Storm
