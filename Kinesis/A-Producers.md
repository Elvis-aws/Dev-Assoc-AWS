# Kinesis Producers
- An Amazon Kinesis Data Streams producer is an application that puts user data records into a Kinesis data stream 
  (also called data ingestion)
- The Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) simplifies producer application development, allowing developers to achieve high 
  write throughput to a Kinesis data stream
- This data is sent into kinesis data stream and fed into shards
- Shards consist of records with similar partition keys
