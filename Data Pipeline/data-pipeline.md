# AWS Data Pipeline
- AWS Data Pipeline provides a managed orchestration service that gives you greater flexibility in terms of the execution 
  environment, access and control over the compute resources that run your code, as well as the code itself that does 
  data processing
- AWS Data Pipeline launches compute resources in your account allowing you direct access to the Amazon EC2 instances or 
  Amazon EMR clusters
- As this option provides access to the underlying EC2 instances so it's not a serverless solution
