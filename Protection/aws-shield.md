# Shield
- It is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS
- DDoS protection prevents malicious traffic from reaching its target, limiting the impact of the attack
  while allowing normal traffic to get through for business as usual
- There are two tiers of AWS Shield: Standard and Advanced
# AWS Shield Standard
- All AWS customers benefit from the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard at no additional charge
- AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that 
  target your website or applications
- When you use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53, you receive comprehensive availability 
  protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks
# AWS Shield Advanced
- For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud 
  (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 resources
- It provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility 
  into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall
- It also gives you 24/7 access to the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT) and protection against DDoS-related spikes in your 
  EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Route 53 charges.
