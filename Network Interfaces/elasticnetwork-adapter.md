# Elastic Network Adapter 
- Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices support enhanced networking via single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to 
  provide high-performance networking capabilities
- Although enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently 
  lower inter-instance latencies
- EFA device provides all the functionality of an ENA device, plus hardware support for applications to communicate 
  directly with the EFA device without involving the instance kernel (OS-bypass communication) using an extended 
  programming interface.
