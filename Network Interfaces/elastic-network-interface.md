- An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
- You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another 
  instance
- The ENI is the simplest networking component available on AWS and is insufficient for HPC workflows
