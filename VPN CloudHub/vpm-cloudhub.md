# VPN CloudHub
- If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the 
  AWS VPN CloudHub
- This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC
- Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub
- The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC
- This design is suitable if you have multiple branch offices and existing internet connections and would like to 
  implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these 
  remote offices
