# FSX File System
- Amazon FSx offers file systems designed for a variety of workload types
- You need to have Active Directory
- You can use AWS FSx as storage for Windows applications, machine learning (ML) and high-performance computing (HPC)
- FSx can also help with electronic design automation
- FSx has two key differentiators compared to other Amazon’s previous file service offerings, such as Elastic File 
  Service (EFS). It comes with a complete file server built in, and it offers superior performance for demanding use cases
# Amazon FSx offers three types of file systems:
- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server: Designed for business applications
- Amazon FSx for Lustre: Designed for compute-intensive workloads. Integrates with S3 thus it can store data in different
  tiers. FSx for Lustre does not support Microsoft’s Distributed File System only linux. FSx for Lustre is a file system 
  better suited for distributed computing for HPC (high-performance computing) and is very expensive
- Amazon FSx for ONTAP: Multiprotocol file and block storage access, with NetApp’s advanced data management system 
  features and benefits
- Does not support EFS
