# S3 Standard IA
- S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed
- S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage 
  price and per GB retrieval fee
- This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a 
  data store for disaster recovery files
- But, it costs more than S3 One Zone-IA because of the redundant storage across availability zones
