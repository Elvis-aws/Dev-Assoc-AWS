# Launch Configuration
- A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances
- When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances such as the ID of the Amazon Machine 
  Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping
- You cannot use a launch configuration to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand 
  Instances and Spot Instances
