# Elastic Fabric Adapter
- An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High 
  Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications
- It enhances the performance of inter-instance communication that is critical for scaling HPC and machine learning 
  applications
- EFA devices provide all Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices functionalities plus a new OS bypass hardware interface 
  that allows user-space applications to communicate directly with the hardware-provided reliable transport functionality
