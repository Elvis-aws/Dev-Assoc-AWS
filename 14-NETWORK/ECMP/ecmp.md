# ECMP
- Equal-cost multipath (ECMP) is a network routing strategy that allows for traffic of the same session, or flow—that is, 
  traffic with the same source and destination—to be transmitted across multiple paths of equal cost
- An ECMP-capable on-premises router is also required to achieve higher throughput beyond the default VPN throughput 
  limits
- Transit gateway supports ECMP but Virtual private gateway does not
- When multiple VPN links are established from on-premises to ESMP-enabled Transit Gateway, throughput can be scaled
