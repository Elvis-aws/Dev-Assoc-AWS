# Enable enhanced networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux instances
- Amazon EC2 provides enhanced networking capabilities through the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
- To use enhanced networking, you must install the required ENA module and enable ENA support
- The Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) is designed to provide Enhanced Networking to your EC2 instances
- With ENA, you can expect high throughput and packet per second (PPS) performance, as well as consistently low latencies 
  on Amazon EC2 instances
- Using ENA, you can utilize up to 20 Gbps of network bandwidth on certain EC2 instance types â€“ massively improving your 
  networking throughput compared to other EC2 instances, or on premises machines
- ENA-based Enhanced Networking is currently supported on X1 instances
