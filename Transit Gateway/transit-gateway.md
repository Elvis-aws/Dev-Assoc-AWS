# Transit Gateway
- AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables customers to connect their Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and 
  their on-premises networks to a single gateway
- You are charged hourly for each attachment on a transit gateway, and you are charged for the amount of traffic 
  processed on the transit gateway
- As your cloud infrastructure expands globally, inter-Region peering connects transit gateways together using the AWS 
  Global Infrastructure
- All network traffic between AWS data centers is automatically encrypted at the physical layer
