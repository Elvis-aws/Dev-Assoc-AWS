# Mapping template
- In API Gateway, an API's method request or response can take a payload in a different format from the integration 
  request or response
# You can transform your data to:
- Match the payload to an API-specified format
- Override an API's request and response parameters and status codes
- Return client selected response headers
- Associate path parameters, query string parameters, or header parameters in the method request
- Select which data to send using integration with Amazon DynamoDB or Lambda functions, or HTTP endpoints
