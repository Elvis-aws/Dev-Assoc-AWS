# AWS Direct Connect
- Private network that by-passes the internet
- We do not want to use the public internet
- For large un-premise data source
- Dedicated private network connection to VPC
- Needs a few days for authorization from AWS
- Establishes a private network between AWS and on-premise Data Centre
- Provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections
- Reliable data transfers at massive scale for real-time analysis
- Network does not fluctuate
- No encryption in transit
- Cheaper but difficult to install
- You can use direct connect partners to set up this connection
- Connection does not fluctuates
# Usage
- AWS Direct Connect is used when customers need to retain on-premises structure because of compliance reasons and have 
  moved the rest of the architecture to AWS Cloud
- These businesses generally have an on-going requirement for low latency access to AWS Cloud and hence are willing to 
  spend on installing the physical lines needed for this connection
