- AWS Application Migration Service simplifies and expedites your migration to AWS by automatically converting your 
  source servers from physical, virtual, or cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS
- It further simplifies your migration and reduces costs by allowing you to use the same automated process for a wide 
  range of applications, without changes to applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers
- You can use AWS Application Migration Service to perform non-disruptive tests prior to cut-over
- After testing, you can use AWS Application Migration Service to quickly migrate your applications to the cloud during 
  a short cut-over window, typically measured in minutes
- You can also use AWS Application Migration Service to automate application modernizations on your migrated servers
