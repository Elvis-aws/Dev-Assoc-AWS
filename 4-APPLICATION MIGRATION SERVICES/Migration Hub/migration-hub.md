# AWS Migration Hub
- AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track 
  the status of each application migration
- The Migration Hub provides visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking
- You can visualize the connections and the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications 
  you are migrating, regardless of which migration tool you are using 
- Migration Hub gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway, or to 
  first discover servers and then group them into applications
- Either way, you can migrate each server in an application and track progress from each tool in the AWS Migration Hub 
- Migration Hub supports migration status updates from the following tools:
1) AWS Application Migration Service
2) AWS Database Migration Service
