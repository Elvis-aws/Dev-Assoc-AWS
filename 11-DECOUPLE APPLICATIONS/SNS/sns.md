# SNS
- Amazon SNS follows the "publish-subscribe" (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients 
  using a "push" mechanism
- This is an important difference between SNS and SQS. Whereas SQS is a polling mechanism, that gives applications the 
  chance to poll at their own comfort, the push mechanism assumes the other applications are present
