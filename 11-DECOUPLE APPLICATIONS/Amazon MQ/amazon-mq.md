# Amazon MQ 
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message 
  brokers in the cloud
- Message brokers allow different software systems–often using different programming languages, and on different 
  platforms–to communicate and exchange information
- If an organization is using messaging with existing applications and wants to move the messaging service to the cloud 
  quickly and easily, AWS recommends Amazon MQ for such a use case
- Connecting your current applications to Amazon MQ is easy because it uses industry-standard APIs and protocols for 
  messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket
