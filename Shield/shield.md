# There are two tiers of AWS Shield: Standard and Advanced
# Standard

  target your website or applications
- When you use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53, you receive comprehensive availability 
  protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks
# Advanced
- For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), 
  Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 resources

  spikes in your EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Route 53 charges
