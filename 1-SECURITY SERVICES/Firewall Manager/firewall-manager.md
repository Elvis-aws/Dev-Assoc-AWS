# Firewall Manager
- AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules 
  across your accounts and applications in AWS Organizations
- As new applications are created, Firewall Manager makes it easy to bring new applications and resources into compliance 
  by enforcing a common set of security rules
- Now you have a single service to build firewall rules, create security policies, and enforce them in a consistent, 
  hierarchical manner across your entire infrastructure, from a central administrator account
