# AWS Security Hub 
- It provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you assess your AWS environment 
  against security industry standards and best practices
- Security Hub collects security data across AWS accounts, AWS services, and supported third-party products and helps you 
  analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues
- To help you manage the security state of your organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards
- This includes the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by AWS, as well as external 
  compliance frameworks
- Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance 
  against security best practices
- In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other AWS services—such as Amazon 
  GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie— and supported third-party products
- This gives you a single pane of glass into a myriad of security-related issues
- You can also send Security Hub findings to other AWS services and supported third-party products
