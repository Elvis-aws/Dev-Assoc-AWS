# Guard Duty
- Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized 
  behavior to protect your AWS accounts, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) workloads, container applications, Amazon 
  Aurora databases, and data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Suspicious activity
# GuardDuty detects three main types of threats:
- Compromised instances: GuardDuty will detect any unusual spikes in network traffic, as well as hijacked resources 
  such as an external IP address hijacking EC2 instances
- Reconnaissance: Reconnaissance is when an attacker gathers information about the network. GuardDuty detects activity 
  that suggests reconnaissance, such as unblocked port probing from a known malicious IP, VPC port scanning, and unusual 
  API activity
- Compromised accounts: GuardDuty will detect common patterns that indicate an account compromise, such as API calls 
  from unusual locations, updates that weaken the accountâ€™s password policy and API calls from known malicious IPs
# How GuardDuty Works
- Cloud Trail Event Logs
    - Unusual API calls
    - Un authorised deployments
- Cloud Trail Management Events
    - Create VPC events
    - Create Subnet events
- Cloud Trail S3 Data Events
    - Get objects
    - Delete objects
    - Put objects
- VPC Flow Logs
    - Unusual Internet Traffic
    - Unusual IP Addresses
- DNS Logs
    - Compromised EC2 Instances sending encoded data
- Kubernetes Audit Logs
    - Suspicious activities
    - EKS Cluster compromise
- Protect against Crypto Currency attack

# GuradDuty
- All these logs will go into GuardDuty
- Findings will be generated
- These findings will then trigger EventBridge rules
- These will then be sent to SNS for notification or Lambda
# Delete Data
- Disabling the service will delete all remaining data, including your findings and configurations before relinquishing 
  the service permissions and resetting the service
